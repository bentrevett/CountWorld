# CountWorld

An environment/dataset creator that deals with counting.

The environment consists of:

- a `world` consisting of `entities`, `objects`, `locations` and `actions`
- `entities`, which are the "actors" or "agents" within the `world`
- `objects`, which the `entities` interact with
- `locations`, which the `entities` "visit" and perform `actions`
- `actions`, which the `entities` perform in `locations` which involve `objects`
